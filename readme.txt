Main goals for the site:

- serve as a "hub" for Movember at Pitt members & Univeristy of Pittsburgh students
- give an outline of the club, and provide links to other sites/socials of the club and foundation
- still work in progress, and needs polishing, but overall layout and links active

Questions and Aims:

- some of the flow of the site does need work, but not sure what else the site can benefit from (potentially some guideing arrows or floating text letting the user know to scroll past hero image
- is it intuituve to use?
- does it feel imcomplete? (in terms of the amount of information presented)
- would it make sense to include more text toward the bottom?
- how would you go about expanding or creating multiple .html pages while keeping the flow organized and somewhat linear?

Work In Progress

- still figuring out how to make the flipcard cleaner
- want to find a way to put more information at bottom, as well as a "scroll to top" button
- figuring out how to better conform <div> around the four text boxes
